🎯 Project Title: Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM & Streamlit
🔍 Overview
This project is an intelligent stock price prediction platform developed as part of my final year project. It uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze and forecast stock prices based on historical financial data and technical indicators.

The application allows users to:

📈 Visualize historical prices, moving averages (MA100 & MA200), RSI, and MACD

🔮 Predict future stock prices for up to 60 days

🤖 Interact with an AI-powered chatbot (via OpenAI GPT) for insights and explanations

🧠 Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, yFinance)

LSTM Model with TensorFlow/Keras

Streamlit for the web application

OpenAI GPT for chatbot integration

MinMaxScaler for data normalization

🛠 Features
User input to select stock and prediction horizon

Real-time charting (historical + forecasted prices)

Technical analysis: Moving Averages, RSI, MACD

AI chatbot trained to answer stock-related queries

Responsive interface using Streamlit tabs

💡 Purpose
The goal is to demonstrate how deep learning and real-time interfaces can support financial forecasting. This project also helps users make informed decisions by combining technical indicators with AI explanations.
